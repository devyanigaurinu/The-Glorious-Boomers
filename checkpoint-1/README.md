# Checkpoint 1

## Questions

1. What is the average (most common) use of force across the police force?
2. How does the average use of force compare between rookies and non-rookies? i.e What is the most common (modal) use of force for rookie officers vs for non-rookie officers?
3. What is the ratio of complaints-to-TRR for rookie officers, and how does this 			compare to non-rookie officers?
4. What is the frequency of TRR reports (update: replaced complaints) for each 			type-of-force for rookie officers vs non-rookie officers?

## Directions for running the code

The SQL code can be used to obtain the results used in each of the four questions. To obtain the results for a given question, run the code highlighted between the comments that indicate that question (for example, to get the results for question 2, run the code between comments "-- Question 1 begins" and "-- Question 1 ends"). For questions 2, 3 and 4, run the Create Table queries first and then run the other queries separately to get the answers. 

Ideally for improved usability, we would separate the SQL code into four separate files to lessen the burden on the user. However, in this case we will follow the assignments instructions to have all the code in a single file. To run the specific sections of the code, highlight the relevant sections of the code in Datagrip, and right-click, and then Execute.
