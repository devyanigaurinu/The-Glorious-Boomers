## CHECKPOINT - 3 : INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION 

In Checkpoint - 3, we aim to answer the following questions:

a) How are TRRs of different types of force distributed across the time spent in the force?

b) How are the TRRs of use of force(per capita) distributed in each unit across an officerâ€™s time spent in that unit?

### To run our code on ObservableHQ,

(1) Open the ObservableHQ link given in findings.pdf or click [https://observablehq.com/@ca91e2be047e14e2/the_glorious_boomers_cp3]

(2) If the csvs are not already linked to the page (i.e. the paper clip on the right does not have a number next to it), click on the paper clip icon, and upload the 2 csvs provided in this submission

(3) Run the cells in the ObservableHQ if they don't automatically update (they should ideally update automatically)




```python
